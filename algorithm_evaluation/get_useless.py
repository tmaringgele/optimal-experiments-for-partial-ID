"""Implementation of GetUselessExperiments (Algorithm 3 from the paper).

Combines two pruning criteria:
1. ID check: single-world experiments whose outcome is identifiable from
   P(V) have zero potency
2. AllPathsBlocked: experiments where all paths from R*_theta to outcomes
   pass through interventions have zero potency

Also provides sampling functions for queries and experiments.
